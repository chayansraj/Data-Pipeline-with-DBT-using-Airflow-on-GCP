# Orchestrate Python ETL Pipeline with Astro and DBT using Airflow on GCP

This project demonstrates how to build and automate an ETL pipeline using DAGs in Airflow and load the transformed data to Bigquery. There are different tools that have been used in this project such as Astro (A docker wrapper around Airflow), DBT (Used for Data Modelling and creating reports using SQL), Soda (Used for Data Quality Checks), Metabase (Containarized Data visualization tool) and Google Cloud Platform for storing the tables.
